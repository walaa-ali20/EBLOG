          Hello everyone, my name is <em>Essra Ali</em>, I am a web developer
          and I graduated from the UOK University College of School of Math ,
          and this is <em>“Where do I start?”</em> Blogg. So I will help people
          who want to learn web development but don't know where to start and
          how.. Let's start with some outlines that will help you facilitate
          what you need to prepare yourself.

        <p>
          <cite>first step </cite>is to figure out what you want to learn from
          the subject I have listed below. It depends on your level of the
          subject.. If you are a beginner and do not know anything about web
          development I suggest that you start from the beginning of the series
          gradually, or if you have a background and want to develop this
          Background just choose from which point you want to start.
        </p>
        <p>
          <cite> second thing</cite> is to choose the time in which you can
          learn. I recommend that it be two days during the week and two hours
          during the day .. But in the end, this depends on you and your
          schedule, so choose the schedule that suits you.
        </p>

            If you want to become a web developer, you need to start learning
            HTML, CSS, and javascrupt. There are a lot of online courses for web
            development, some are free and some are not but they have a
            certificate, I will include some references for you below. let's
            start..

        <!----- HTML CONTENT-------->

        <section>
          <h1>HyperText Markup Language</h1>
          <h2><cite>what is HTML :</cite></h2>
          <p>
            First developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, The HyperText Markup
            Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents
            designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by
            technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages
            such as JavaScript. Each page contains a series of connections to
            other pages called hyperlinks.HTML code ensures the proper
            formatting of text and images for your Internet browser. Without
            HTML, a browser would not know how to display text as elements or
            load images or other elements. HTML also provides a basic structure
            of the page
          </p>
          <h2><cite>HTML Syntax : </cite></h2>
          <p>
            HTML documents are composed of textual content and HTML elements.<br />
            <em>HTML element encompasses </em><br />
            • the element name within angle brackets (i.e., the tag) and <br />
            • and also contain attributes.<br />
            • and content within the tag.<br />

            <img src="bloog-img/elements.png" class="img" />
            <br />
            An empty element does not contain any text content; instead, it is
            an instruction to the browser to do something. • In XHTML, empty
            elements had to be terminated by a trailing slash. • In HTML5, the
            trailing slash in empty elements is optional.<br />

            <img src="bloog-img/empty element.png" class="img" />
          </p>

          <h2><cite>HTML Tags : </cite></h2>
          <p>
            HTML tags are used to define the content of an HTML dokument.The
            tags start with a < (less-than sign) and end witn a > (greater-than
            sign).This way < p > and < /p > are used to mark up the beginning
            and the end of a paragraph.
          </p>

          <p>
            &lt; !DOCTYPE html &gt; The document type is HTML<br />
            &lt; html&gt; &lt; /html&gt; The beginning and the end of the
            document<br />
            &lt; head&gt; &lt; /head&gt; The beginning and the end of document
            information<br />
            &lt; title&gt; The title of the book ("My Book")<br />
            &lt; meta charset="UTF-8"&gt; The character set used (UTF-8)<br />
            &lt; body&gt; &lt; /body&gt; The beginning and the end of the
            visible content<br />
            &lt; h1&gt; &lt; /h1&gt; The beginning and the end of a heading<br />
            &lt; p&gt; &lt; /p&gt; The beginning and the end of a paragraph<br />
          </p>
          <h2>Basic HTML Document Structure</h2>
          <p>
            we're going to create a basic HTML document structure by going
            straight to the editor and coding one up ourselves <br />
            So every HTML page should start with the doc type or document type
            declaration. The words doc type or HTML could be lower or upper
            case. The only thing you have to watch out for is that there
            shouldn't be any space between less than exclamation point and the
            word doc type it does is tell the browser that it should get ready
            to render HTML. This declaration is really largely historical. When
            HTML standards were first becoming popular, the web was full of
            pages that were not compliant with the standards. To help browsers
            render those pages correctly, browsers used the doctype declaration
            to distinguish between noncompliant and compliant pages.
            Noncompliant pages were rendered in what's called the quirks mode,
            and the compliant pages were rendered in what's called the standards
            mode. goes the html tag, and that's basically a tag that contains
            the entire html document. After the html tag, goes the head tag. The
            head tag contains items that describe the main content of the page.
            Things like what character coding should the browser use for the
            main content. It can contain authors description of the page, page
            title, and whatever other external resources are needed to render
            the page properly, among other things. The point is it contains some
            metadata about the main content. Also note that the meta tag is a
            stand alone tag Next we'll specify the title of the page. The title
            is one of the tags that is actually required to be here. Without it,
            the HTML will be invalid. Play video starting at :3:40 and follow
            transcript3:40 After the head tag goes the body tag. The body tag is
            the root of all content that is visible to the user. It is often
            referred to as a viewport. We can now write our content. One
            important rule when nesting html tags is that you have to close the
            last opened tag before you close its parent tag. If you don't, the
            html you wrote is invalid. When the browser opens an HTML page. It
            always renders or interprets the HTML code sequentially from top to
            bottom. So the doctype declaration gets interpreted first, then the
            HTML tag, then the head tag, and on and on until it hits the last
            closing HTML tag.
